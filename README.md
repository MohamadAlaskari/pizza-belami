# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter for Pizza Belami, developed in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

Developed by Alaskariteck Development.

## Setup Instructions (Manual Reference)

Download the app files and extract them to <your next app>/src/app.
Because these files follow Next.js conventions, the corresponding HTML markups will be automatically generated.

Download the public files and extract them to <your next app>/public.

Insert the following code in the head section of <your next app>/src/app/layout.tsx:
`<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Pizza Belami" />`
(Note: This meta tag is already added to the layout.tsx in this project's codebase.)
